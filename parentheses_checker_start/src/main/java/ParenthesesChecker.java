    /* the goal is to write a method called check parentheses

    the method should take in a string
    and return a boolean

    return true if the string contains "correct" pairs of parentheses
    return false if not

    situations to return false:
    more opening or closing brackets of a particular type (), <>, {}, []
    closing bracket at start
    opening brackets followed by two closing brackets


    can look at the tests to see what the different situations would be
